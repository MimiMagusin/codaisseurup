<h1> CodaisseurUp</h1>

Created for the 9 week intensive program at Codaisseur. An 'MeetUp - clone' that explores features such as authorization with Devise, uploading and editing events as a user, registering for events from a different user, uploading pictures in rails (we made use of cloudinary) and finally some testing! We made use of RSpec. And this project includes my very first API! As you might notice navigation needs to be improved, just as the homepage (a very first attempt with a bootstrap template).
